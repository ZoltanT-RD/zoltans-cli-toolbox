I assume you're reading this, because you got stuck with the repo or one of its packages...

First and foremost, worry not!

## steps to follow

- read the [readme](/README.md) again; you might have missed something silly
- there're check in place for this, but double check your environment (node/npm/etc. versions) meets the minimum criteria
- if nothing above works
  - and it can wait, add a new [Issue](https://github.com/ZoltanT-RD/zoltans-cli-toolbox/issues), and someone will get back to you
  - and it can not wait, reach out to one of the [Authors](./AUTHORS.md) directly for support
